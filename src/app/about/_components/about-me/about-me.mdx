ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is **Fayyadh Abdurrahman** I was born on July 7, 2005 in Bogor, then moved to Bekasi and lived there.

Started programming since 2019 learning Javascript to build a discord bot. After a few months, I felt confident and decided to take on a new challenge by learning how to create a website using html and css at the end of 2020.

Once I understood how to creating a website, I started to experiment with other technologies such as React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS to build more advanced websites. Although I faced some difficulties during the learning process, I remained determined and tried to overcome every obstacle that came my way.

Through programming, I have discovered a passion for problem-solving and creative thinking, and I look forward to continuing to develop my skills and knowledge in this exciting field.
